        </div>
    </div>

    <p><a href="http://projectbismark.net">BISmark</a>, the Broadband Internet
    Service benchmark, is a project led by
    <a href="http://gtnoise.net">Georgia Tech</a> and the
    <a href="http://www.grid.unina.it/Traffic/">University of Napoli</a> to
    develop an <a href="http://openwrt.org">OpenWrt</a>- &amp;
    <a href="//cerowrt/">CeroWrt</a>-based platform for performing measurements
    of ISP performance, as well as network traffic inside the home.</p>

    <a name="current"><h2>Current status</h2></a>
    <p>BISmark currently has two active deployments: one in Atlanta, GA,
    United States and one in Cape Town, South Africa. This release is in
    support of our third deployment which will be located in a number of
    cities in the United States and Europe.</p>

    <p>BISmark currently performs measurements of participants' broadband
    Internet connections using an active measurement suite that measures
    latency, throughput, and other connection characteristics throughout
    the day.</p>

    <a name="goals"><h2>Future goals</h2></a>
    <p>The current status of the BISmark project represents only a small part
    of our plans for the project. Our plans for the future of the BISmark
    project and platform include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A large, international deployment to enable measurement of many
        different topology arrangements, service providers, access
        technologies, and market and regulatory environments.</li>
        <li>A passive measurement suite to measure home network user
        behavior and application usage.</li>
        <li>The development of Network dashboard, a tool to enable users to
        monitor their Internet service performance and usage, and compare their
        performance and behavior with other participants.</li>
        <li>The inclusion of the Kermit home network management interface, a
        user interface that seeks to reconceptualize home network management
        tasks in a more user-friendly way than conventional home router
        interfaces.</li>
    </ul>
