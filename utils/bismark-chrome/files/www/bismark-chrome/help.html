  <p>BISmark is an experimental research project and is offered <a
  href="#no-warranty">without support or warranty</a>.  We cannot provide
  support for your home network, any computers or devices connected to the
  BISmark router or your home network, or your Internet service.</p>

  <p>We <i>do</i> have a community of BISmark users and developers that may
  be able to help you if you run into problems with your BISmark router. See
  below for how best to obtain support from this community.</p>

  <a name="help"><h2>How to get help</h2></a>

  <p>You should always attempt to first solve problems by yourself. If you
  are having a problem, begin by working through the <a href="docs.html">
  BISmark documentation</a>.  If that does not help, then try one or more of
  the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Do not contact Netgear. They cannot help you with the BISmark
    software.</b></li>
    <li>Read the <a href="docs.html">BISmark documentation</a>.</li>
    <li>Attempt to isolate the cause or nature of the problem. It is much
    easier to provide help with specific problems statements (&quot;DNS
    resolution is failing after I change my firewall settings&quot;) than
    vague problem statements (&quot;Websites sometimes don't load&quot;).
    <li>Ask for help on the
    <a href="http://lists.projectbismark.net/listinfo/bismark-discuss/">
    bismark-discuss mailing list</a>. Members of the BISmark team and user
    community are on this list and can often provide help and assistance.
    </li>
    <li>If you believe the problem is a fault with the BISmark software or
    system, please <a href="contact.html#feedback">provide feedback</a> so
    we can file a bug.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="no-warranty"><h2>No Warranty</h2></a> <p>As described in the
  <a href="http://projectbismark.net/participant/notices/">participation
  agreement</a>, the BISmark router is provided "as is" with no warranty of any
  kind. We may be able to provide help or support from time to time, but we are
  not obligated to provide help or support.</p>
