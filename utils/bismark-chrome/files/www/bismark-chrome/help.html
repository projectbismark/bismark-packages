    <p>BISmark is an experimental research project and is offered <a
    href="#no-warranty">without support or warranty</a>.  We cannot provide
    support for your home network, any computers or devices connected to the
    BISmark router or your home network, or your Internet service.</p>

    <p>We <i>do</i> have a community of BISmark users and developers that may
    be able to help you if you run into problems with your BISmark router. See
    below for how best to obtain support from this community.</p>


    <a name="help"><h2>How to get help</h2></a>
    <p>You should always attempt to first solve problems by yourself. If you
    are having a problem, begin by working through the <a href="docs.html">
    BISmark documentation</a>.  If that does not help, then try one or more of
    the following:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><b>Do not contact Netgear. They cannot help you with the BISmark
        software.</b></li>
        <li>Read the <a href="docs.html">BISmark documentation</a>.</li>
        <li>Attempt to isolate the cause or nature of the problem. It is much
        easier to provide help with specific problems statements (&quot;DNS
        resolution is failing after I change my firewall settings&quot;) than
        vague problem statements (&quot;Websites sometimes don't load&quot;).
        <li>Ask for help on the
        <a href="http://lists.projectbismark.net/listinfo/bismark-discuss/">
        bismark-discuss mailing list</a>. Members of the BISmark team and user
        community are on this list and can often provide help and assistance.
        </li>
        <li>Ask for help on <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#bismark">IRC
        (#bismark)</a>. Members of the BISmark team and user
        community can sometimes also provide help here.</li>
        <li>If you believe the problem is a fault with the BISmark software or
        system, please <a href="contact.html#feedback">provide feedback</a> so
        we can file a bug.</li> </ul>

    <a name="no-warranty"><h2>No Warranty</h2></a> <p>As described in the <a
    href="http://projectbismark.net/agreement/"> participation agreement</a>,
    the BISmark router is provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind. We may
    be able to provide help or support from time to time, but we are not
    obligated to provide help or support.</p>
